As seen in the the last few generations, artists working in clay have shattered traditional roles by refusing to accept that making functional work sealed your status as a potter or craftsman. By willingly accepting the challenge of making works that exert the same aesthetic agendas of painting and sculpture, two of the most traditional art forms, the line of demarcation between longstanding oppositional categories has never been so uncertain or more irrelevant.\n\nArtists in this exhibition include, but are not limited to: Peter Voulkos, Jun Kaneko, Jason Garcia, Robert Arneson, Bill Stewart, Gerry Eskin, Viola Frey, Benj Upchurch, Ron Meyers, and Kurt Weiser.
